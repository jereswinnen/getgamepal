The player traverses post-apocalyptic environments such as buildings and forests to advance the story. They can use firearms, improvised weapons, and stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. The game intermittently switches control between Ellie and Abby, and also briefly Joel in the opening sequence. The nimble nature of the player character introduces platforming elements, allowing the player to jump and climb to traverse environments and gain advantages during combat.","total_rating":93.03266760828247,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii","videos":[{"id":16543,"game":26192,"name":"PSX 2016 Announcement Trailer","video_id":"muniWyT4vTg","checksum":"6ab9c6d9-b44d-69ea-a814-55362026dca8"},{"id":16589,"game":26192,"name":"PGW17 Interview Trailer","video_id":"HfxOtvmpsM8","checksum":"f3a92b0f-066c-7ae5-b94d-a0ba525d1064"},{"id":33735,"game":26192,"name":"4K Trailer","video_id":"t-BUJoqZRsw","checksum":"16f8b4a6-9f57-9d4a-5629-d50f2f3fa491"},{"id":35943,"game":26192,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"mRj3B3GY9KM","checksum":"61f52369-3e58-15a3-0ee2-159ff81b63ae"},{"id":16588,"game":26192,"name":"PGW17 Trailer","video_id":"ArAdN5ilVRs","checksum":"d769ee81-7939-19e5-b044-02126cb34fd3"},{"id":16542,"game":26192,"name":"Discussion","video_id":"gF1EQAtaZEo","checksum":"89ffda56-e75c-d24b-bfc2-a8872ef7e351"},{"id":30066,"game":26192,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"II5UsqP2JAk","checksum":"5fe363b3-b10a-c38c-3bb7-3ea5a161fded"},{"id":20624,"game":26192,"name":"E3 2018 Trailer","video_id":"jziBvTUdCB0","checksum":"f4df81bc-9ba6-f675-914a-d0e9480ea088"}]}
