Earth has been destroyed by an intergalactic war between two alien races, and humanity is on the brink of annihilation. A small number of survivors, aboard the USS White Whale, crash land on the vast and untamed planet Mira—and now it falls to you, as a member of BLADE, to help bring humanity back from the edge of extinction…with the aid of powerful giant robots called Skells!\n\nThe visually enhanced edition of this open-world RPG contains newly added story elements and more.\n\nTake on tough foes in a robust combat system, and pilot powerful giant robots called Skells\n\nChoose from a huge variety of special attacks, skills, and classes in a combat system that’s as deep as you want it to be. Once you’ve proven yourself to BLADE, you’ll earn the right to pilot and personalize your very own Skell—a powerful machine that can fly, transform into a vehicle for fast overland travel, and wield immense strength in combat with customizable weapons and armor.\n\nGather resources and take on missions to build the community of New Los Angeles\n\nAs you go about the reconstruction effort, getting to know the people of New Los Angeles (NLA), you’ll build affinity with your party members and unlock quests for gear and other rewards. Join your choice of military organization within BLADE to take on even more missions—or even team up with up to 32 players from near and far online* in Squad Tasks, Online Missions, and extra-challenging Global Nemesis Battles!","total_rating":86,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition","videos":[{"id":131073,"game":321048,"name":"Announcement Trailer","video_id":"meabXp-IFkM","checksum":"75f4fbcf-e419-d438-d54f-d832f8eeda22"}],"franchise":null}
