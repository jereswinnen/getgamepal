Like most other titles in the series, The Minish Cap features the fully explorable land of Hyrule, although it can be viewed from the eyes of a human or the eyes of a Minish, a race of tiny people and an alternate form that Link can transform into. Unlike the multiplayer focus of the other games in the series, The Minish Cap retains the original form of exploration and dungeons as seen in A Link to the Past, Oracle of Seasons, and Oracle of Ages, as well as returning characters and game mechanics such as Malon and the Spin Attack. New features include fusing Kinstones and shrinking to the size of a Minish.","total_rating":87.27064542667426,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-the-minish-cap","videos":[{"id":15521,"game":1035,"name":"Trailer","video_id":"cSIDghMWVMA","checksum":"db85b5c6-2220-71eb-f153-ed1b6085b5bb"}],"franchise":null}
