        We use TelemetryDeck for app analytics. TelemetryDeck is a
        privacy-focused service that helps us determine which features of
        GamePal are actively used so we can improve the app experience. Any data
        sent to TelemetryDeck is anonymous and only includes general information
        about app usage, such as feature engagement and device type. No
        personally identifiable information is ever collected or shared with
        TelemetryDeck.

        GamePal does not collect any of your personal data. The app does not
        track you across other apps, websites, or the internet in general.
